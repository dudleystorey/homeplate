<p>A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Computer, belay that order. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? The unexpected is our normal routine. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. Shields up! Rrrrred alert! The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers?</p>
